# Smart Helmet Project using IoT
This project is based on IoT and involves the creation of a smart helmet that can communicate with the rider's smartphone using radio frequency communication. The helmet has an accelerometer and a gyroscope that are used to detect accidents and automatically send an SOS signal to the rider's emergency contact.

The code for this project is written in Arduino and uses the RH_ASK library for radio frequency communication. The helmet sends a signal to the rider's smartphone using the library when an accident is detected. The signal consists of a Y if an accident has occurred and an N if no accident has occurred.

# Installation
- Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/piyush-p7/IOT-Smart-Helmet`.
- Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
- Open the Arduino IDE and load the code from the downloaded repository.
- Compile and upload the code to the Arduino board.
- Connect the accelerometer and gyroscope to the Arduino board.
- Connect the radio frequency transmitter to the Arduino board.
- Assemble the helmet with the accelerometer, gyroscope, and radio frequency transmitter.
- Power up the Arduino board and the helmet.

# Usage
Wear the helmet while riding a bike. In case of an accident, the accelerometer and gyroscope will detect the impact and send a signal to the rider's smartphone using radio frequency communication. The rider's smartphone will receive the signal and automatically send an SOS signal to the emergency contact.
